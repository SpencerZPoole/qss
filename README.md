# Quick Status Select

Quick Status Select adds a search row to Foundry VTT's Token HUD status-effect palette, making it faster to find and apply conditions or effects on a selected token.

## Install

In Foundry, open **Add-on Modules > Install Module**, paste a manifest URL into **Manifest URL**, and install.

Spencer's Foundry V14 compatibility build:

https://github.com/SpencerZPoole/qss/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

## Compatibility

- Module version: `2.0.3`
- Foundry VTT: minimum `13`, verified `14.362`
- Verified test environment: Foundry `14.362` with D35E `3.0.2`

Quick Status Select is intended to remain system-agnostic for systems and modules that preserve Foundry's standard Token HUD status-effect palette.

## Usage

1. Enable **Quick Status Select** in your world.
2. Select a token and open the Token HUD.
3. Open the status/effects palette.
4. Type in the **Search:** field to filter statuses by id or localized label.
5. Press Enter to apply the first visible matching status, or click any visible icon.

## Changes in 2.0.3

This release keeps the existing QSS experience and focuses on Foundry V14 compatibility and HUD polish:

- Verified the module on Foundry VTT `14.362`.
- Replaced regex filtering with plain-text matching, so special characters in the search field cannot trigger invalid-regex errors.
- Restored a visible **Search:** row with a `Status` placeholder in the Token HUD status palette.
- Kept the search row compact and part of the icon grid while filtering, preventing a large blank overlay area from appearing above filtered results.
- Reset the palette scroll position as the filter changes, so matching icons stay anchored below the search row.
- Kept Enter-to-apply and clickable status icons working with the filtered results.
